## What is Purview?

Once you have submitted your design document, a link to it should be included. Additionally, a list of the milestones timeline from that document should be included in HTML form on your website, along with adjustments to the timeline as the project progresses and the goals shift.

Once your team has developed its "elevator speech", that should also be included on the website.

Your project's elevator speech should be a single paragraph that states clearly and succinctly what your system does. What would you say if you were alone in an elevator with Bill Gates for 60 seconds, and wanted him to fund your project? The speech should be a short attention-grabbing description without big words but with good buzzwords.
